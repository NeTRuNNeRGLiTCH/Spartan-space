# 🔱 Titan Log Pro V2: Algorithmic Performance Engine

**"Don't just log. Program your evolution."**

Most gym apps are digital versions of a paper notebook. They track what you *did*, but they don't understand the logic of growth. **Titan Log Pro V2** is a high-fidelity training terminal that treats physical progression as a software engineering problem.

With the introduction of **TitanScript**, your workout plan is no longer a static list—it is a living, programmable algorithm.

## ⚡ New in Version 2.0: The Engine Update

### 1. TitanScript DSL (Domain Specific Language)
The core of V2.0 is a custom-built, human-readable functional language. Users can now "Engrave" logical protocols directly into their exercises to automate auto-regulation and progression.
*   **Sentential Logic:** Uses simple English-style syntax (`WHEN`, `DO`, `OTHERWISE`) terminated by a command period (`.`).
*   **Stateful Memory:** Support for ephemeral variables using `STORE [value] AS [name]` to compare historical data against live performance.
*   **Iterative Context:** Dynamic set-pointers (`set(this)`) allow for complex loops that generate pyramids and dropsets in a single line of code.

### 2. The Protocol Forge (Visual IDE)
A dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) built into the terminal.
*   **Live Telemetry:** Real-time syntax highlighting (Cyan for Keywords, Green for Data, Orange for Pointers).
*   **Logic Guard:** A built-in compiler that detects typos (`sit1` vs `set1`) and scope violations before they are saved to the core.
*   **Command Palette:** A configurable Tri-Button bar for rapid logic injection on mobile devices.

### 3. Master Codex
A high-fidelity technical manual accessible directly from the Forge. It provides deep-dive documentation on lexer rules, mathematical operators, and logic branching for non-developer athletes.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### 1. Recursive Node Blueprints
The system utilizes a **Hierarchical Tree Structure** instead of flat lists. Exercises inherit global recovery specs from "Root Blueprints" but support "Local Shadowing" for specific high-intensity overrides.
*   **Standard Recovery:** Global set-to-set rest logic.
*   **Module Transition:** Defined "Neural Recharge" periods between different exercise modules.

### 2. Titan Telemetry (Biometrics)
Built-in physiological analysis engine tracking you against your natural biological ceiling:
*   **The Casey Butt Model:** Skeletal-anchor based muscular potential calculation.
*   **FFMI & Density:** Tracking tissue density and muscularity rarity.
*   **Symmetry Detection:** Flags structural "glitches" (bilateral imbalances) with 0.5cm sensitivity.
*   **Equilibrium Polygon:** 6-axis radar mapping of Power, Symmetry, Rarity, and Volume.

### 3. The Relic Archive
A persistence layer that verifies significant structural milestones (SBD Tiers, Greek Convergence, and Circadian patterns) through automated history scanning.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Upgraded)

*   **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart 3.7+) for a high-contrast, low-latency Terminal UI.
*   **Database:** **ObjectBox (Vector NoSQL)**. Migrated from Hive to support high-performance recursive relations and faster indexing for infinite history.
*   **Logic Engine:** **TitanScript V4.5**. A custom-built interpreter with recursive function calling (`CALL`) and stateful memory registry.
*   **Library:** 300+ Exercise Archive with dedicated **Calisthenics & Skill** protocols.

## 🚀 Initializing the System

1.  **Clone the Archive:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NeTRuNNeRGLiTCH/Spartan-space.git
    ```
2.  **Generate Database Schema:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
3.  **Launch Terminal:**
    ```bash
    flutter run --release
    ```
